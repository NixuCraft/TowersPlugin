Not done:
Proper no chest yoink
Chest cooldown (?)
Anti spawnkill (?, more cancer than anything, maybe as a config)

To redo/improve:
Chests overrall (refill only some chests, save chests by team, basically a TowerChest obj w props like "baseContent" "canEnemySteal", "refill", ...)
better block break handling (?, basically prevent most structure break but not all eg not stairs near goal?)
